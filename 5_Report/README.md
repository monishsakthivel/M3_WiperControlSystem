# **Wiper Control System**

## **Introduction**

In vehicles, a wiper control framework replaces the standard wiper sharp edge with an electrical part. In this arrangement, the start button (on the engine) will be constrained by a solitary switch in the ACC position. Switch on the wiper framework with a subsequent press, then shift the wiper speed with a third press, lastly switch off the engine with a fourth press. All of this was finished with the assistance of LEDs and a recreation tool.A wiper is an essential part that eliminates precipitation or some other fluid from the windscreen of a vehicle. The past strategy required manual wiper actuation, and raising the wiper was an extreme undertaking. Therefore, this framework is being introduced as an answer for these issues. The's task will likely stockpile cleaning frameworks for more established autos, work on the framework by utilizing actuators and pull switches (involving similar switch for different capacities by stepwise exchanging), and oversee motor and wiper speed with a solitary switch. This System directs the wiper's activity speed because of how much downpour. This Wiper Speed Control System is used in a wide range of cars, and its essential capacity is to eliminate downpour air drops from the vehicle's front screen.

## **Features**

When the button is pressed ONCE, the automobile will be locked.

When the button is pressed TWICE, the automobile will open.

When the button is pressed THREE times, it will turn on and move clockwise.

When the button is pressed FOUR times, it will wiper off and move in an anticlockwise manner.

When the button is pressed FIVE times, the wiper will complete one cycle.

## **SWOT Analysis**

### **Strength**

Visual clarity.
Operation Silent.
The wiper does not stop in the middle of the window.
We can control the wiper speed using just one button.

### **Weakness**

Increased Replacement Costs
Rubber Blades are required.
Wiper motor problems

### **Opportunities**

Opportunities for safety and good health
Possibilities for Promotion
Increase as a wiper system is required for installation.

### **Threats**

Advance Technology has taken its place.
In the rain, wiper blend could be a problem.


## **4'W & 1'H**

### **Who**

Anyone who wishes to be safe and have clear visibility in bad weather.

### **What**

It is a Wiper Speed Control System programme for all automobiles.

### **Why**

Switching between controls and wipers is simple.

### **When**

In difficult environmental conditions, such as a rainy climate,

### **How**

After wiping the windsheet of motor vehicles, the LED displays the position of the wiper and returns to its normal state.
